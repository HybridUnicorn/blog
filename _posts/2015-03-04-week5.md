**Project Status** ![green]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/orange.png) Orange


**Work completed since previous meeting**

Some alpha testing has be done since the previous meeting. With these, we can say that we are on the right way. No bugs were found, we have some feedback about our game feature. We know that players are not lost in our game, and so, we can continue on this way.

With the teacher, we see that our document needs improvement. The main point is to describe our software development methodology. We are going to choose between the waterfall model and the spiral one.


**Work planned before next meeting**

- Improve "Game implementation"
- Choose a software development methodology


**Any Other Business**

I think from the week I'm going to focus on implementing the game.
