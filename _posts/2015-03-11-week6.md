**Project Status** ![green]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/red.png) Red


**Work completed since previous meeting**

This week we tried to focus on implementing the game. But we did nothing, and the game is as done as the past week.

Beside that, we have done some documentation. We have choose our software development methodology, the *spiral model*.

But we still need to have the game done before we can write the documentation about it.  

**Work planned before next meeting**

- Continue to implement the game


**Any Other Business**
