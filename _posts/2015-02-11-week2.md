**Project Status** ![green]({{ site.base }}/images/green.png) Green


**Work completed since previous meeting**

For the project we are no longer using *CoffeeScript*. Instead, we are going to use *TypeScript*. The main feature is that *TypeScript* is **typed**. Before running our code we have to compile it. And so, the benefit is that syntax are showed *on compilation* and not *on runtime* like with *CoffeeScript*. Another benefit of working with a typed language, is that we can have a powerful auto-completion. For *TypeScript*, *Visual Studio 2013* handle the auto-completion like no one else, and enable us to focus on features, and not on code syntax bug.

The first step was to get a functional workspace. It has to integrate *git*, auto-compile *TypeScript* and comes with code auto-completion. For this purpose, we are going to use *Visual Studio 2013*.


**Work planned before next meeting**

- Re-font game prototype
- Push game prototype to the new game repository
- Write some documentation


**Any Other Business**

*No*
